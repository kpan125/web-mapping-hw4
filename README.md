# web-mapping-hw4

Source data for this homework was taken from two sources. The regional shapefile was taken from the [NYC Planning Metro Explorer](https://metroexplorer.planning.nyc.gov/about), while the actual gentrification typologies were provided by the [Urban Displacement Project](http://www.urbandisplacement.org/) at UC Berkeley for my CUSP capstone team (data and typologies are already public!).

The typology data was joined to the regional shapefile and then exported as a geojson with QGIS.
